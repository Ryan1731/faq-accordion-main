## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Please go easy on me, this is the first challenge I submitted on Frontend Mentor.

I learned to use the DOM to control the height of each question boxes. This challenge was a great way to practice DOM manipulation. Sorry for not attempting to add keyboard navigation. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to focus on writing better forEach loops, and perhaps continue on more DOM-related challenges.
